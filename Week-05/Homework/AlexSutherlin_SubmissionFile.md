### Step 1: Create, Extract, Compress, and Manage tar Backup Archives

1. Command to **extract** the `TarDocs.tar` archive to the current directory: sudo tar xvvf TarDocs.tar

2. Command to **create** the `Javaless_Doc.tar` archive from the `TarDocs/` directory, while excluding the `TarDocs/Documents/Java` directory:  sudo tar cvvf Javaless_Docs.tar --exclude=/home/sysadmin/Projects/TarDocs/Documents/Java /home/sysadmin/Projects/


3. Command to ensure `Java/` is not in the new `Javaless_Docs.tar` archive: sysadmin@UbuntuDesktop:~/Projects$ tar tvvf Javaless_Docs.tar | grep Java

**Bonus** 
- Command to create an incremental archive called `logs_backup_tar.gz` with only changed files to `snapshot.file` for the `/var/log` directory: sudo tar cvvWf logs_backup.tar.gz --listed-incremental=logs_back.snar --level=0 /var/log

#### Critical Analysis Question

- Why wouldn't you use the options `-x` and `-c` at the same time with `tar`? If you start a tar with -x flag for a file that hasn't been created or exist, you can't extract it and will result in error. You would need to use the -c flag to create the file before you can use the -x flag.

### Step 2: Create, Manage, and Automate Cron Jobs

1. Cron job for backing up the `/var/log/auth.log` file: 0 6 * * 3 tar zcf /var/log/auth_backup.tgz /var/log/auth.log
1 6 * * 3 gzip -t /var/log/auth_backup.tgz >> /var/log/auth_backup_validation.txt

---

### Step 3: Write Basic Bash Scripts

1. Brace expansion command to create the four subdirectories: mkdir ~/backups/{freeme,diskuse,openlist,freedisk}

2. Paste your `system.sh` script edits below:

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    free -h >  ~/backups/freemem/free_mem.txt
    du -h > ~/backups/diskuse/disk_usage.txt
    lsof > ~/backups/openlist/open_list.txt
    df -h >  ~/backups/freedisk/free_disk.txt
    ```

3. Command to make the `system.sh` script executable: sudo chmod +x system.sh

**Optional**
- Commands to test the script and confirm its execution: sudo ./system.sh

**Bonus**
- Command to copy `system` to system-wide cron directory: sudo cp system.sh /etc/cron.weekly/

---

### Step 4. Manage Log File Sizes
 
1. Run `sudo nano /etc/logrotate.conf` to edit the `logrotate` configuration file. 

    Configure a log rotation scheme that backs up authentication messages to the `/var/log/auth.log`.

    - Add your config file edits below:

    ```bash
    /var/log/auth.log {
        weekly
        rotate 7
        notifempty
        delaycompress
        missigok
    }

    ```

### Bonus: Check for Policy and File Violations

1. Command to verify `auditd` is active: sudo systemctl status auditdsudo

2. Command to set number of retained logs and maximum log file size:

    - Add the edits made to the configuration file below:

    ```bash
    max_log_file = 35
    num_logs = 7
    ```

3. Command using `auditd` to set rules for `/etc/shadow`, `/etc/passwd` and `/var/log/auth.log`: sudo nano /etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules


    - Add the edits made to the `rules` file below:

    ```bash
    -w /etc/shadow -p rwa -k hashpass_audit
    -w /etc/passwd -p rwa -k userpass_audit
    -w /var/log/auth.log -p rwa -k authlog_audit
    ```

4. Command to restart `auditd`: sudo systemctl restart auditd

5. Command to list all `auditd` rules: sudo auditdtcl -l

6. Command to produce an audit report: sudo aureport

7. Create a user with `sudo useradd attacker` and produce an audit report that lists account modifications: sudo aureport -m

8. Command to use `auditd` to watch `/var/log/cron`: sudo auduitctl -w /var/log/cron

9. Command to verify `auditd` rules: sudo auditctl -l

### Bonus (Research Activity): Perform Various Log Filtering Techniques

1. Command to return `journalctl` messages with priorities from emergency to error: journalctl -p "emerg".."err" OR journalctl -p 0..3

1. Command to check the disk usage of the system journal unit since the most recent boot: journalctl --boot=-0

1. Comand to remove all archived journal files except the most recent two: journcalctl --vacuum-files=2


1. Command to filter all log messages with priority levels between zero and two, and save output to `/home/sysadmin/Priority_High.txt`: journalctl --priority=0..2 > /home/sysadmin/Priority_High.txt

1. Command to automate the last command in a daily cronjob. Add the edits made to the crontab file below:

    ```bash
    0 0 * * * journalctl --priority=0..2 > /home/sysadmin/Priority_High.txt 
    ```
